### Project Fork and Enhancements with Jetpack Compose

This project is a fork of the original PokeApp code, to which I've added several enhancements, focusing on UI improvements with Jetpack Compose. Major updates include:

- **UI Migration**: 
    - Migrated UI to use Jetpack Compose, allowing smoother animations and more responsive layouts.
- **New Main and Pokedex Screens**:
    - The app now has a dedicated Pokedex screen displaying all available Pokémon in a grid layout. Added detailed loading states.

The result is an application with a responsive, Compose-driven UI that makes navigating and discovering Pokémon both intuitive and enjoyable.

Note: A detail screen is yet to be implemented.
